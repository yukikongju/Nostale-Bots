## Understanding How the Bots work

We will use [yolov7](https://github.com/WongKinYiu/yolov7) for object detection.
To do so, we will need to create and annotate our dataset using either
[roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com/) or [labelImg](https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg). 
This process can be quite tedious because we need to label over 150+ 
images. Once the bot can detect the object, we just need to tell the bot 
what command to execute. We will accomplish this task using [pyautogui](https://pypi.org/project/PyAutoGUI/).
